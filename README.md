# Project Objectives
1. **Database Design:** Create an optimal schema that supports the various functionalities required for an online clothing store, including tables for products, customers, orders, payments, and more.
2. **Data Management:** Implement efficient data management practices to handle large volumes of data, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and security.
3. **Query Optimization:** Develop optimized SQL queries to facilitate fast and accurate data retrieval for various use cases such as product searches, order tracking, and sales analytics.

# Platform Used for the Project
MySQL Workbench

# Files to Refer for Creation of Tables
You can find the final query to create all the tables for the database with all the foreign key linkages in the folder:
Table Creation
|-------> final_query.sql

# Sample Entries for the Tables
The CSV files named according to the table names of the database are in the folder "Entries for Tables" containing some sample entries for each of the tables. You can import the CSV files directly into the database:
Entries for Tables
|-------> .csv files

# ER-Diagram of the Database
After creating all the tables, the ER-Diagram looks like this:
